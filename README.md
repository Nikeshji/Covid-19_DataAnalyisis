# COVID-19 Worldwide Data Analysis (April 29, 2020)

This repository contains an analysis of COVID-19 data from around the world, specifically focusing on data up to April 29, 2020.

## Overview

This project aimed to:

* Filter and aggregate COVID-19 data by region.
* Identify key statistics such as the region with the highest confirmed cases and the lowest death count.
* Extract and present specific data for India, Yemen, and the United States.
* Sort the data by confirmed and recovered cases for further insights.



## Methodology

1.  **Data Cleaning:**
    * Removed records with fewer than 10 confirmed cases to focus on regions with significant impact.
2.  **Data Aggregation:**
    * Grouped data by region and calculated the total confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases for each region.
3.  **Analysis:**
    * Identified the region with the maximum confirmed cases.
    * Identified the region with the minimum deaths.
    * Extracted and presented data for India, Yemen, and the US.
    * Sorted the data by confirmed and recovered cases in ascending order.
4.  **Tools:**
    * Python
    * Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
